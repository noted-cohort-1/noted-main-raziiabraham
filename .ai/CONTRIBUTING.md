# `.ai/` — Shared agent configuration

This folder is the source of truth for everything Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor pick up automatically when teammates open this repo. We use the `.ai/` convention so a single set of skills and commands works across every agent runtime — `.claude/` and `.cursor/` are auto-generated symlinks (see `scripts/sync-ai.mjs`).

## Structure

```

## How it gets to each runtime

`scripts/sync-ai.mjs` — runs automatically after `npm install` (postinstall hook), and can be run manually with `npm run sync-ai`. It materializes `.ai/skills/` and `.ai/commands/` as symlinks at:

- `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` (Claude Code)
- `.cursor/skills/` and `.cursor/commands/` (Cursor)

It also creates root-level `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` as symlinks to `.ai/INSTRUCTIONS.md`. All symlink targets are gitignored — only `.ai/` is tracked.

## When to use which

- **Skill** — you're in the middle of a task (writing a PRD, defining metrics, summarizing a market scan) and want the agent to follow a team-agreed structure automatically. Triggered by phrasing.
- **Command** — you want to run a named workflow explicitly (`/prd-new`, `/ship-log`, `/noted-review`). Shows up in the `/` menu in Claude Code and Cursor.
- **`INSTRUCTIONS.md`** — passive context. Loaded every session so the agent knows the map.
- **Reference implementations** — [team-os/engineering/reference-implementations.md](../team-os/engineering/reference-implementations.md) — canonical code to copy, not prose alone.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `.ai/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter: `name`, `description`, optional `trigger` patterns.
2. Add a row to [reference-implementations.md](../team-os/engineering/reference-implementations.md) if the skill introduces a pattern agents should copy from real code.
3. If it's credit-worthy (adapted from a public repo), add a line to `CREDITS.md`.
4. Run `npm run sync-ai` to materialize it across runtimes.
5. Open a PR. `.ai/` ownership follows the same merge policy as the rest of the repo (see `INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

## Adding a new command

1. Create `.ai/commands/<name>.md` with a clear "Instructions" section.
2. Run `npm run sync-ai`.
3. Test it by typing `/<name>` in Claude Code or Cursor.

## Deterministic enforcement

Skills alone are not enough — pair new non-negotiables with:

- A row in [team-os/engineering/constitution.md](../team-os/engineering/constitution.md)
- A custom ESLint rule in `eslint-rules/noted/` with an AI-friendly error message (see [reference-implementations.md](../team-os/engineering/reference-implementations.md#eslint-guardrails-deterministic))
- A check in `/noted-review` if the rule is not automatable
