# Noted

Collaborative, AI-native note-taking app (Notion-style) by avidx-app. This repo holds both the **code** that ships the product and the **Team OS** — a shared knowledge base every team member (engineering, product, design, customer service, leadership) reads, queries, and contributes to.

> This file is the source of truth for project-wide agent instructions. Root `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are auto-generated symlinks pointing here. Run `npm run sync-ai` to (re)materialize the symlinks across `.claude/` and `.cursor/`.

## Team

See [team-os/ROSTER.md](team-os/ROSTER.md).

## Rules of the road

- **Cross-functional by default.** Non-engineers are first-class contributors to `team-os/`. If you're not sure where something goes, read [team-os/CONTRIBUTING.md](team-os/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Feature not "done" until team-os updated.** When a PR merges to `main`, append an entry to the feature's `ship-log.md` (PR link, merge date, coverage delta, deploy status). Use `/ship-log` to automate.
- **Prefer reading a folder's CLAUDE.md before opening files.** Nested CLAUDE.md files are navigation maps — they save everyone tokens and time.
- **When switching tasks, `/clear` first.** Leftover context pollutes results.
- **Never fabricate data, quotes, or metrics.** Flag gaps with `[NEED: data from X]`.

## AI playground (self-healing loop)

This repo is set up so humans and agents can ship compliant PRs without engineer babysitting. The loop:

1. **Skills + reference code** — follow `.ai/skills/`; copy patterns from [reference-implementations.md](team-os/engineering/reference-implementations.md).
2. **Deterministic guardrails** — CI runs Prettier, TypeScript, ESLint (including custom `noted/*` rules), tests, and build. Warnings on legacy debt (`any`, hard-coded colors) ratchet to errors over time.
3. **Before opening a PR** — run `/noted-review` (skill compliance) and the [code-quality-checklist](.ai/skills/code-quality-checklist/SKILL.md) commands.
4. **Self-healing docs** — when you change code in an area covered by a skill or architecture doc, update that doc in the **same PR** if the change extends or contradicts the documented pattern. Update `reference-implementations.md` when you establish a new canonical example.

GitHub posts an [AI playground checklist](.github/pull_request_template.md) on every new PR. Non-engineers: ask the agent to _"address all items in the AI playground checklist."_

## Code conventions (all agents)

- **File naming**: kebab-case for files and directories (e.g., `coworker-message.tsx`).
- **Component exports**: PascalCase for React components.
- **Framework**: Next.js App Router (v16). Default to Server Components; use `'use client'` only for client hooks and browser APIs.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui. Reuse components from `components/ui/` before building custom ones. Avoid inline styles.
- **Tests**: Colocated (`foo.tsx` next to `foo.test.tsx`). Jest + React Testing Library. Mock Clerk and Convex at test top.
- **Coverage**: maintain >50% frontend coverage (`npm run test:coverage`).
- **Setup**: `npm install` → `npm run dev` (with `npx convex dev` in a second terminal). `npm install` also runs `npm run sync-ai`, which materializes `.ai/skills/` and `.ai/commands/` as symlinks under `.claude/` and `.cursor/`. Re-run manually with `npm run sync-ai` if you add or rename a skill/command without reinstalling.

## Merge policy

- `team-os/**` — PRs can be opened and merged by any teammate with write access. See `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- Everything else — PRs require approval from `@avidx-app`.
- All merges go through PRs. Branch flow: feature → `staging` → `main`.
